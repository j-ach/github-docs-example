# Writing good documentation

## step 1 - Using codeblocks

Codeblock in markdown make it **very easy** for tech people to copy, paster, share code.
A good cloud engineer uses code blocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code replicate or research issues.

- In order to create codeblocks in msrkdown you need to use thee backticks (```)
- Not to be confused with (''')

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
    print("This is part of the if block")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
    print("This is part of the else block")

# Code outside the if-else block
print("This is outside the if-else block")
```
